# Time and Space complexity

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.

**Time Complexity**  
Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

**Space Complexity**  
Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent
but the comparison is also more appropriate.

## How to represent complexity?

Asymptotic notations

- Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity

1. Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (θ-notation) - Average case complexity
