# Big-O Notation

The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation

Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

It has two important characteristics

- It is expressed in terms of the input
- It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details

In Big O, there are six major types of complexities (time and space):

- Constant: O(1)
- Linear time: O(n)
- Logarithmic time: O(n log n)
- Quadratic time: O(n^2)
- Exponential time: O(2^n)
- Factorial time: O(n!)

So, the worst time complexity of the above problem would be:  
O(n) - Linear
