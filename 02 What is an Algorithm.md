## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

### Example

Algorithm to add two numbers:

Input -> Algorithm -> Output

**Input:**  
Two numbers `a` and `b`

**Algorithm:**

1. Add numbers using `+`
2. Return the value

**Output:**  
Some of `a` and `b`

### Characteristics

- Well defined input and output
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous
- Language independent
